Using a variety of machine learning methods and comparing them to predict patient mortality in hospital emergency rooms in Python.

Note: One of the training features is "Apache death prediction", which is reflective of a hospital's own prediction of whether or not a patient will survive. Because this is domain knowledge that a pure data science perspective wouldn't have, I have opted to run the analysis both including and without it (Apache death features removed .py).
